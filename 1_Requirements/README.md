# REQUIREMENTS
## INTRODUCTION
Electricity Bill system is specially designed for the purpose of calculating total electricity bill consumed. In this system, user has to enter total units consumed, user details and the total sum amount is displayed according to the state. The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. It’s easy to operate and understand by users. The design is so simple that user won’t find it difficult to use and navigate.
## RESEARCH

The field of power system is varied vast, ranging from the age-old concepts of electrical machines, overhead line parameters, star-delta topologies, etc, to simple, yet essential skills like calculating Electricity billing. The electrical power system mainly consists of generation, transmission and distribution. For generation of electrical power we have many PSUs and private owned Generating Stations (GS). The electrical transmission system is mainly carried out by central government body PGCIL (Power Grid Corporation of India Limited).
## DEFINING OUR SYSTEM
Our System mainly focuses finding the cost of the electricity consumed by consumer. Our System is robust, just user has to enter the units consumed by seeing from the electric meter and his meter id. It gives total bill according to his location and id. This is useful for every consumer who didn’t even know about the power systems.

# STATE OF ART
## COST
### Administration side:
•	Production cost depends upon total operation period of development.
•	Application cost is minimal in range.
•	Wages for developer who updates application
### User side:
•	No registration cost for user
•	Application is offline mode, therefore no running cost.
•	No annual maintenance cost.

# FEATURES
•	To make the billing system more service-oriented and simple,
•	The application has high speed of performance with accuracy and efficiency.
•	The software provides facility of data sharing.
•	It doesn’t require any staffs as in the conventional system. Once it is installed on the system, only the meter readings are to be given by the customer.
•	The electricity billing software calculates the units consumed by the customer and makes bills.
•	It has the provision of security restriction.
•	It requires small storage for installation and functioning.
•	There is provision for debugging if any problem is encountered in the system.
## ELECTRICAL CALCULATIONS INCLUDE
 Calculations include calculating total bill of consumer/user according to units consumed by consumer and area he belongs to.
